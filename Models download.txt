Models are currently available on my Gdrive. (december 2020)

These models are only working with the ecosystem gpt2tc.exe and gpt2Explorer.exe 
They were created from original model checpoints via the gpt2convert.py utility.

First, Download the small model and check if it works under your computer with a decent answer time.
Then you might want to test bigger models.
All models should be placed in the Gpt2Explorer directory.
