# GPT2Explorer
This is basically a portable stand-alone text generator for windows using GPT2 OpenAI released models in 2019 for commonplace nowadays laptops/desktop computers.

GPT2Explorer is simply a basic window graphical user interface wrapping the demo gpt2tc.exe command line generator engine from Fabrice Bellard. 

Quick Start
After unpacking the folder, you should also add the content of https://bellard.org/nncp/gpt2tc-2020-07-25.tar.gz to the GPT2-Explorer folder.
It should run stand-alone on windows10 64bit with a decent cpu and 4Gb Ram, by clicking on GPT2-Explorer.exe .
117M (small) model, is included in this initial package and is the default.
Load the filter named 'NoFilter.flt' and click on the Generate button, wait 5 seconds and read.

My 2017 laptop pc delivers 32 words/s with the small model, XL model can run on a 8Gb RAM recen laptop (altough it can take minutes to deliver outputs)
Answer time can be quite different depending on your hardware performances.

See help.txt for more detailed info.

Other model will have to be built separately or downloaded ( need still to figure this out).

Writers, curious, teachers and poets and others, have fun but use responsibly.
This is much more for educational purpose than anything else.

Don't expect much support, i'm a desesperate amateur with the machines and i have work, life etc.
